# Wingline

A right-sidebar panel (`src/panel.tsx`) and the plugin's own worker (`src/worker.ts`). The panel asks with `plugin.request`, the worker answers with `orca.panels.handle`, keeps the total in `orca.storage` and tells every open panel with `orca.panels.post`; `src/protocol.ts` types both sides. Orca transpiles both files when they load, so there is no build step: save and the panel or worker reloads (a worker reload drops its in-memory state, so keep what must last in storage). `orca plugin test .` runs `src/panel.test.tsx` and `src/worker.test.ts` in Node with `orca/testing`, and `orca plugin check .` renders the panel with the worker in each `src/panel.check.ts` scenario; `npx tsc -p .` type-checks against the typings `orca plugin types .` writes to `.orca/types/`. With the folder loaded, `orca plugin dev request . counter.add --data '{"by":1}'` calls the worker as the panel does.

## Develop

```sh
orca plugin validate .
orca plugin dev watch .    # loads this folder into Orca and prints its logs and reloads; Ctrl-C unloads it
```

Orca names the publisher after where the plugin is installed from: the GitHub or GitLab owner of
its repository, or `local` for a folder. See
